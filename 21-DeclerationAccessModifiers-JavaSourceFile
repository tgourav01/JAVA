	// A java program can contain any number of classes but utmost 1 class can be declared
	// as public  if there is a public class then the  name of the program and name of the public
	//class must be matched otherwise we will get CE

	/* CASE1
	 if  there is no public class then we can use any name and there are no restriction 
     
     CASE2
     if class B is public then name of program should be B.java
     otherwise we will get CE:B is public,should be declared in a file name B.java
     
     CASE3: we can't declare more than 1 class public in a program(source file)
     if class B and C declared as public and name of the program is B.java then we will get 
     CE:C is public should be decalred in file name C.java 
     
        EXAMPLE:
        
        in file durga.java
        
        class A{
        public static void main (String args[]){
        System.out.println( A main method );
        }}
        
         class B{
        public static void main (String args[]){
        System.out.println( B main method );
        }}
        
         class C{
        public static void main (String args[]){
        System.out.println( C main method );
        }}
        
         class D{
        public static void main (String args[]){
    
        }}
        
        
        after compiling we will get 4 separate class file as A.class B.class C.class D.class
        we can run these file
        java A will be give output:A main method
        
        java B will be give output:B main method
        
        java C will be give output:C main method
        
        java D will be give RE:NoSuchMethodError(because jvm looks for main method)
        
        java Durga RE:NoClassDefFoundError:Durga
        
        
        CONCLUSIONS:
        
        1. whenever we are compiling  a java program for every class present in the program
        a separate class file will be generated
        
        2.we can compile a java program (java source file)but we can run only a java.class file
        
        3.whenever we are executing a java class the corresponding main() will be executed
        if the class doesn't contain main() the we will getCE:NoSuchMethodError:main
        
        4.if the corresponding .class file is not available then we will get RE:NoClassDefFoundError:
         
        5. It is not recommended to declare multiple classes in a single source file.
        	It is highly recommended to declare only one class per source file and name of the 
        	program we  have to keep same as class name.The main advantage of this approach is
        	readability and maintainability will be improved.
        	
        	////////////////IMPORT STATEMENT/////////
        	
        class Test{
         
        public static void main (String args[]){
        ArrayList i=new ArrayList();
                }
        }
        CE:can not find symbol
        symbol: class ArrayList
        location:class Test
        
        we can solve this problem by using fully qualified name  like this:
        
        java.util.ArrayList i=new java.util.ArrayList();
        but every time we use it will increase length of code and reduce readability
        
        we can solve this problem by using import statement like this:
        
        import java.util.ArrayList;
        class Test{
        }
        now we don't need to use fully qualified name we can use short  names.
