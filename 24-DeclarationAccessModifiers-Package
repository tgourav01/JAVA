 /*
    • It is an encapsulation mechanism to group related classes and interfaces into a single unit.
     for e.g database classes and interface are in single package java.sql
     
    • The main advantage of package are :
     1.To resolve naming conflict
     2.It improves modularity of the application.
     3.It improves the maintainability of the application.
     4.It provides a security for our components.( access outside package type)
     
    • There is one universally accepted naming convention for packages :
        to use Internet domain name in reverse
        com.icicibank.loan.housing.Account
      
      1.com.icicibank:client Internet domain name in reverse.
      2.loan:Module name
      3.housing:sub module
      4.Account :class name 
      
    •Files can be compiled as:
       
       Test.java source file
       
    package com.durga.scj;
    public class Test{
    p s v main(String []args){
    sop("hello");
    }
    }
    
    1.javac Test.java will generate the class file in current working directory.
    
    2.javac -d . Test.java will generate the class file in 
      current working directory/com/durgasoft/scjp/Test
      
      if the package doesn't exists the command itself will create the package structure.
     
    3  As destination. can be replaced with any directory name for eg if f directory exists then
       javac -d F: Test.java will generate the class file in 
      F/com/durgasoft/scjp/Test
     
    4 if specified directory not exists for e.g z dont exisits
     	javac -d Z:Test.java
      then we will get CE: directory not found z:
      
      
   • At the time of the execution of the file we have to use the fully qualified name for e.g
      
      java com.durgasoft.scjp.Test
      
    •CONCLUSIONS:
    1.In any java source file there can be atmost 1 package statement otherwise we will get CE:
    
    for e.g:
    package pack1;
    package pack2;    
    public class A{
    }
    }
    CE:class interface or enum expected.
    
    2.In any java program teh first non comment line should be package statement(if its available)
       otherwise we will get CE
       
       import java.util.*;
       package pack1;       ----  CE
       public class  A{
       }
       }
       
       CE: class, interface,enum expected
